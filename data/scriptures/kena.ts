    'Belongs to the Sāma Veda. 35 mantras in four sections — two in verse, two in prose. Asks the most fundamental question of all philosophy: who or what is the power behind perception itself? Famous for the paradox: he who thinks he knows does not know.',

      titleSanskrit: 'प्रथम खण्ड',
      summary:
        'Nine verses. Who directs the mind, the breath, the speech, the eye, the ear? Brahman is identified as the very power of perception — the ear of the ear, mind of the mind. Not what is known, but that by which all knowing happens.',

          translation:
            'By whose will does the mind, sent forth, alight on its objects? By whom is the first breath set moving? By whose will do men speak this speech? What god directs the eye and the ear?',

          explanation:
            'The Upanishad opens with the most fundamental question in philosophy — not "what exists?" but "what is the power behind perception itself?" The inquiry is turned away from objects and toward the unseen subject behind every act of knowing.',
          science:

          explanation:
            'Brahman is not an object of perception — IT IS the power of perception itself. It cannot be seen; it is that by which the eye sees. One of the most precise formulations of the witness-Self in any philosophy.',

            'Brahman is not "the unknown" — that would still place it in the category of objects. It is the very third category: not known, not unknown, but that which makes both knowing and not-knowing possible. The verse opens space beyond the knowledge/ignorance binary.',
