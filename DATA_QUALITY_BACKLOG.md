# Data Quality Backlog — `scriptures-full`

_Audit of `public/data/scriptures-full/*.json` — the JSON the web and mobile
apps read directly. 65 scriptures, 316,102 verses. Refresh the
numbers with `python scripts/audit-data-quality.py`._

## Status (re-measured 2026-09-29)

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| **P0** — romanized → Devanagari | ✅ **Done** — `npm run migrate:devanagari` |
| **P2** — header-artifact verses | ✅ **Done** — `tsx scripts/strip-header-artifacts.ts` |
| **P1** — missing English translations | ⚠️ **Open** — 48/65 complete; worst: mahabharata (10%, 29k missing), agnipuran, naradapuran, brahmapuran (`npx tsx scripts/_coverage-report.ts`) |
| **P1b** — missing Hindi (bulk corpus) | ⚠️ **Open** — 53/65 complete; worst: shivpurana, brahmapuran, brahmandpuran, skandapuran, manusmriti (35%), durgasaptashati (2%) (`npx tsx scripts/_hindi-coverage-report.ts`) |
| **P3** — durgasaptashati misalignment | ✅ **Done** — structural `chapter.id` + `verse.id` merge (16/16 aligned) |
| **P2b** — mangled mixed-script headers | ✅ **Done** — parser fix + `fix-mixed-script-verses.ts` (0 mixed-script verses remain) |

## TL;DR

The corpus is broad but, after the P0/P2 fixes, now renders in clean
Devanagari throughout. What remains is depth (translations) plus two small,
bounded cleanups.

---

## P0 — Romanized Sanskrit → Devanagari ✅ DONE

~24 scriptures (**0 romanized files remain**) stored their `sanskrit` as
romanized text instead of Devanagari, seeded from a romanized source without
the transliteration step `scripts/seed-puranas.ts` applies to sanskritdocuments
ITRANS files.

**Fix applied** via `scripts/migrate-romanize-to-devanagari.ts`
(`npm run migrate:devanagari -- --write`): converted **130,807 verses** across
24 files. The files used two schemes — IAST (the big Puranas) and ITRANS (the
smaller Upanishads/sutras) — so the script detects each file's scheme and
converts with the right one; converting with the wrong scheme produces garbage.
The original romanization is preserved in the `transliteration` field. The
script only touches purely-romanized verses (zero Devanagari), so the mangled
mixed-script lines in P2b are deliberately left untouched. Idempotent.

---

## P2 — Header artifacts removed ✅ DONE

GRETIL/source metadata ingested as fake verses: Upanishad title lines
(`.. Maitri (Maitrayani) Upanishad ..##`, `॥ … ॥ .. XopaniShat ..endtitles`)
and bare section markers (`.. 8..`).

**Fix applied** via `scripts/strip-header-artifacts.ts`: removed **34 artifact
verses across 18 files** and decremented each `totalVerses`. The matcher is
deliberately precise — it does NOT touch real verses that merely begin with
".." (harivanshpuran) or the mixed-script lines in P2b. Verified: removals
exposed the real first verses (e.g. ishavasya now opens on
`ॐ ईशा वास्यमिदँ सर्वं…`).

---

## P2b — Mangled mixed-script lines ✅ DONE

_Newly discovered during P0/P2._ Some verses mix Devanagari, Latin and ITRANS
markup in a single `sanskrit` field. They split into two kinds:

**(a) Clean verse + English editorial note — FIXED (7).** A real, complete
Devanagari śloka with an English annotation stuck on: a source credit
(atharvaveda `By Dr. … Lucknow, India. <verse>`), a "(verses missing)" note
(manusmriti 3.57), or a Brahmasutra variant label (`पाठभेद 1.4.5 and 6 combined
ॐ … ॐ`). Dropping the non-Devanagari cleanly recovers the verse. Fixed via
`scripts/clean-mixed-headers.ts` (an explicit, hand-verified allowlist — a
blanket strip is unsafe, see below). atharvaveda ×1, manusmriti ×1,
brahmasutra ×5.

**(b) Conflated title/invocation/verse blobs — NOT auto-fixable (45).** These
need a fix in the **seed pipeline** (`scripts/seed-puranas.ts`), not a data
patch, because the romanized text often *is* real verse content:

- **Purana canto headers (36): `bhagavatapurana` 13, `devibhagavat` 12,
  `shivpurana` 11.** Each chapter's first entry is a blob of mangled-Devanagari
  title + maṅgala invocation + (for bhag/devibhag) **verse 1.1.1 in ITRANS**.
  Blindly stripping Latin reduces the blob to just its title — *losing the
  opening verse of the Bhagavatam / Devi Bhagavatam*. The seed parser should
  separate title, invocation, and verse 1 instead.

  **Root cause + fix DRAFTED (pending re-seed).** Confirmed two bugs in
  `scripts/lib/itrans-parser.ts`: (1) `cleanItx` *unpacked* `\engtitle{}` /
  `\itxtitle{}` document-title tags into the body, so the English title
  ("…Bhagavatam Canto 1…") was transliterated into the `ष्रिमद् Bहगवतम्`
  gibberish; (2) the maṅgala invocation (unnumbered, bare `||`) before verse 1
  was folded into verse 1 by `extractVerses`. Fixed by dropping title tags +
  `endtitles` in `cleanItx`, and a new `stripFrontMatter()` that cuts to the
  first numbered verse — wired into `seed-puranas.ts`. Verified offline on a
  fixture (`npm run test:parser`): the first verse now resolves to a clean
  `जन्माद्यस्य यतोऽन्वयादितरतः…`. **To apply, re-run `npm run seed:puranas`**
  (needs network to sanskritdocuments.org); eyeball verse 1 of each Purana
  afterward, especially `devibhagavat` whose verse-marker format differs.
- **`brihadaranyaka` (4):** a Devanagari mantra followed by a duplicate of
  itself in ITRANS, plus `[IV.iv.3]` refs and `मर्क्` markers — needs de-duping.
- **`manusmriti` (2, verses 7.87/7.206):** Devanagari verse + transliterated
  English commentary note + a second verse in ITRANS, conflated in one field.
- **`yogavasishtha` 1, `vivekchudamani` 1, `brahmasutra` 1:** leftover title
  blobs (e.g. `॥ विवेकचूडामणिः ॥एndtitles`) that P2 missed because `endtitles`
  was partly transliterated. Safe to drop once confirmed the real text follows.

**Fix applied (2026-06-23).** Purana canto headers were already clean in
`scriptures-full` (parser fix in `itrans-parser.ts` verified via
`npm run test:parser`). Remaining 16 mixed-script verses fixed via
`scripts/fix-mixed-script-verses.ts --write`: shivpurana ×5 title blobs
removed, brihadaranyaka ×4, manusmriti ×2, yogarasayanam ×5. Verify:
`python scripts/audit-data-quality.py` (`mix` column — 0 across corpus).

---

## P1 — Missing English translations ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)

All **65** `scriptures-full` JSON files now have **100% English translation
coverage** (316k+ verses). Seeded via public-domain sources (GRETIL, Tagare,
Ganguli, Griffith, Dutt, Pargiter, etc.) with sequential prose→śloka mapping
where 1:1 alignment does not exist. Verify: `npx tsx scripts/_coverage-report.ts`.

---

## P1b — Missing Hindi (bulk corpus still open)

Curated highlight verses (~1,261 in the reader UI) have Hindi; the bulk
`scriptures-full` corpus does not. Needs *sourced* Hindi (machine translation
of śloka isn't trustworthy for a scripture app). Sequence by reader demand:

- **Tier A:** the 10 mukhya Upanishads, Ramayana, Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu
  Purana, Manusmriti, Vidura Niti.
- **Tier B:** remaining Upanishads, Durga Saptashati (finish + fix P3 mapping).
- **Tier C:** the large Puranas (huge verse counts, lower per-verse demand).

The reader degrades gracefully (Sanskrit-only when no translation exists).
Consider a catalog `hasTranslation` flag so the UI can label "Sanskrit only".
Largest gaps:

| Scripture | Verses |
|---|--:|
| `mahabharata` | 73,821 |
| `shivpurana` | 25,198 |
| `ramayana` | 22,742 |
| `devibhagavat` | 18,386 |
| `naradapuran` | 15,600 |
| `bhagavatapurana` | 14,103 |
| `brahmapuran` | 13,796 |
| `brahmandpuran` | 13,745 |
| `rigveda` | 10,499 |
| `skandapuran` | 6,724 |

_Only `bhagavadgita` (701) and `nityakarmakriya` (16) have full translation + Hindi; `durgasaptashati` ~3%._

---

## P3 — Misaligned translations (durgasaptashati) ✅ DONE

`mergeCuratedChapters()` in `scripts/lib/curated-merge.ts` now matches curated
verses by **Sanskrit fingerprint** (not verse-number suffix). One-off cleanup:
`scripts/lib/curated-merge.ts` now matches by the predefined structure:
curated `chapter.id` + `verse.id` ↔ seeded `"{chapter}.{id}"` (e.g. ch2 id10 →
`2.10`). One-off cleanup: `npx tsx scripts/fix-durgasaptashati-alignment.ts
--write` — all 16 hand-authored verses aligned, 634 mūla verses preserved.
Future re-seeds via `npm run seed:missing` inherit this automatically.

## P4 — Chapters with mixed verse numbering (needs a human decision)

`node scripts/fix-verse-order.mjs` re-sorts verses only where every number has one shape. These 18 chapters mix schemes (e.g. `1`, `1.2`) or step back across sections, so they are reported, not changed. Ramayana ch1-7 and Manusmriti ch1 look like curated selections; Shivpurana ch9/ch10 and atharvaveda ch20 were plain text-order sorts with a few odd numbers; fixed on 2026-09-29 via the FORCE_MIXED allowlist in the script. The rest need a human decision.

```
  bhagavatapurana.json ch1: mixed numbering (2/1), 6 out of order — left as is
  brahmasutra.json ch1: mixed numbering (1/3), 4 out of order — left as is
  devibhagavat.json ch7: mixed numbering (1/2), 2 out of order — left as is
  devibhagavat.json ch12: steps back across sections, 3 out of order — left as is
  mahabharata.json ch7: mixed numbering (1/2), 7 out of order — left as is

## Why the translation gaps must not be "refilled" from the seed caches

The English/Hindi gaps in P1/P1b are what is left after `scripts/dedupe-bulk-translations.ts`
removed passage-level text that the Purana and Mahabharata seeders had copied onto every verse
of a passage. Re-running e.g. `npm run seed:mahabharata-translations` reports 100% coverage but
re-creates the problem (checked 2026-09-29: Mahabharata 8.1.6 showed Janamejaya's opening
paragraph as the "translation" of a Duryodhana verse; ~3,200 distinct texts across 32,540
verses, one repeated 208 times, plus `[paragraph continues]` scraping artifacts).
Closing these gaps needs a **verse-aligned** source, not more passage-level text.

### P4 resolution (2026-09-29)

The remaining 15 chapters were inspected: Ramayana ch1–7 are curated 13–16-verse selections per kanda
(numbers like `1, 1.2, 3, 4, 1.6 … 2.10, 1.14` are selection order, not a sort bug) and Manusmriti ch1 is a
sparse selection (`1, 1.2, 3, 4, 1.15, 1.20, 1.25`). Their order is intentional — leave them. The
bhagavatapurana/devibhagavat/mahabharata/shivpurana/brahmasutra entries are 2–7 verses each and are left as is.
